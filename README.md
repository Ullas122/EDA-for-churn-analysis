 Telco Customer Churn Analysis
 
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior in the telecom industry using Python. The goal is to identify the key factors that influence churn and provide actionable insights that businesses can implement to retain customers.

 Tools & Technologies
 
* Python (Pandas, NumPy)

* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

* Jupyter Notebook

 Project Highlights
 
* Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis (handled missing values, data types, and encoding).

* Explored relationships between customer churn and features like:

* Contract type (Month-to-month vs. yearly)

* Tenure (how long a customer has stayed)

* Internet service type

* Use of services like Online Security and Tech Support

* Payment methods

 Key Insights 
 
* 43% churn among month-to-month customers vs. 11% and 3% for 1- and 2-year contracts.

* Senior citizens and new customers (≤4 months) showed higher churn.

* Customers with bundled services (e.g., Tech Support, Online Security) were less likely to churn.

* Higher churn observed among Fiber Optic users and those paying via Electronic Check.

 Business Recommendations
 
* Promote long-term contracts through discounts.

* Improve onboarding experience for new users.

* Bundle value-added services to increase engagement.

* Encourage alternative payment methods with rewards.

 Outcome
 
This project demonstrates my ability to perform end-to-end data analysis, generate actionable business insights, and communicate findings effectively — skills that are directly applicable to roles in data analysis and business intelligence.
